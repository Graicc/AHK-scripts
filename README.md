# AHK-scripts
A collection of the AHK scripts that I use. Feel free use them.

# Changes to your normal input devices
This script is based around the idea of layers. The main layer used right now is a alt layer opened by holding the right alt key (*Note: This may affect keyboard shortcuts already mapped to the alt layer*). There are also a few general and application specific rebindings.

## Chrome Keybindings
* Mouse Wheel Left / Right -> Swap tabs left and right (^tab / ^+tab)
* Mouse Back + Left / Right Click -> Close and restore tabs (^w / ^+t)
* Mouse Back + Left / Right Click -> Swaps desktops (^#{left} / ^#{right})
* Mouse Back + Middle Muouse Button -> Mouse Forward

(*Note: I also use https://gist.github.com/sedm0784/4443120 for remapping capslock to escape if tapped and control if held down*)

## Other Layers
There are also layers contained in the script

### Alt Layer (*Activated by holding Alt*)
(*Note: You can change what alt key triggers it by selecting the swap alt option from the context menu on the system tray icon*)
* HJKL -> Left, Up, Down, Left respectively (This is different from the standered LDUR convention)
* U / I -> Home / End
* Control + J / K -> Mouse Wheel Up / Mouse Wheel Down
* Backspace -> Del
* F -> Appskey, down, enter (Autocorrects a word in Google Drive)

(*Note: This list is complete :)*)
