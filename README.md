# AHK-scripts
A collection of the AHK scripts that I use. Feel free use them.

# Changes to your normal input devices
This script is based around the idea of layers. The main layer used right now is a alt layer opened by holding the right alt key (*Note: This may affect keyboard shortcuts already mapped to the alt layer*). There are also a few general rebindings, such as capslock to escape.

## Normal Keybindings
* Capslock -> Escape
* Mouse Wheel Left / Right -> Swap tabs left and right (^tab / ^+tab)
* Mouse Back + Left / Right Click -> Close and restore tabs (^w / ^+t)
* Mouse Back + Left / Right Click -> Swaps desktops (^#{left} / ^#{right})
* Mouse Back + Middle Muouse Button -> Mouse Forward

## Other Layers
There are also layers contained in the script

### Alt Layer (*Activated by holding Alt*)
* HJKL -> Left, Up, Down, Left respectively (This is different from the standered LDUR convention)
* Backspace -> Del
* F -> Appskey, down, enter (Autocorrects a word in Google Drive)

(*Note: This list is complete :)*)
