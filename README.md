# AHK-scripts
A collection of the AHK scripts that I use. Feel free use them.

# Changes to your normal input devices
This script is based around the idea of layers. The main layer used right now is a alt layer opened by holding the right alt key (*Note: This may affect keyboard shortcuts lready mapped to the alt layer*). There are also a few general rebindings, such as capslock to escape.

## Normal Keybindings
* Capslock -> Escape
* Mouse Wheel Left / Right -> Swap tabs left and right (^tab / ^+tab)

## Other Layers
There are also layers contained in the script

### Alt Layer (*Activated by holding Alt*)
* HJKL -> Left, Up, Down, Left respectively (This is different from the standered LDUR convention)
* Q - ] -> F1 - F12
* Backspace -> Del
* F -> Appskey, down, enter (Autocorrects a word in Google Drive)
* D -> Backspace (Very usefull in word editing with one hand on the mouse)
(*Note: This list is complete :)*)
